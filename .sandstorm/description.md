The IPython Notebook is an interactive computational environment, in which you
can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and rich media

It aims to be an agile tool for both exploratory computation and data analysis,
and provides a platform to support reproducible research, since all inputs and
outputs may be stored in a one-to-one way in notebook documents.

This fork has been modified to include the [Angr](http://angr.io)
reverse-engineering packages & dependencies, and the [PyPy](http://pypy.org)
kernel for theoretically increased speed for Angr.

A demonstration of this package can be found
