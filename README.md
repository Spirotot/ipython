Original README is below.

# Sandstorm package for IPython Notebook

There is no source code in this top level directory, because we don't need
to make any modifications to the upstream app to get it to run in Sandstorm!

To get started:

```
$ vagrant-spk vm up
# wait a few minutes while all the packages are installed in the VM...

$ vagrant-spk dev
```
